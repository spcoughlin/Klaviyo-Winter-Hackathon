🐦 BirdieDeals

Smarter golf equipment deals, personalized to your bag and how you play.

BirdieDeals is a golf-focused affiliate marketplace that helps golfers find better equipment deals by understanding their actual golf bag, playing habits, and skill level.

Instead of blasting generic promotions, BirdieDeals uses golf-specific data like club lofts, distances, play frequency, and budget preferences to recommend deals that actually make sense for each golfer.

How it works

Build your golf profile
Golfers create an account and enter:

Their clubs and specs

Handicap and distances

How often and where they play

Budget and brand preferences

Golf-specific intelligence
BirdieDeals analyzes the bag to detect:

Distance gaps

Worn wedges and grips

Mismatches between skill level and equipment

Upgrade timing based on usage, not hype

Personalized deal recommendations
Golfers see:

Featured deals anyone can browse

Suggested deals tailored to their bag and play style

Value-first options like used and previous-generation gear

Lifecycle marketing powered by Klaviyo
Golf profile data and intent signals are sent to Klaviyo to:

Build high-intent segments

Trigger email or SMS recommendations

Personalize messaging using golf-specific context

Why BirdieDeals

Most golf deal sites treat every golfer the same.

BirdieDeals is built around the idea that what you should buy depends on what’s already in your bag, how often you play, and what actually improves your game.

This approach:

Reduces bad recommendations

Builds trust with golfers

Creates higher-quality affiliate traffic for brands
